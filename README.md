 This module contains the following algorithms: the standard MinHash algorithm for binary sets andseveral Consistent Weighted Sampling algorithms(CWS、ICWS、I2CWS、PCWS、CCWS、0-bit CWS、SCWS).Each algorithm converts a data instance (i.e., vector) into the hash code of the specified length,and computes the time of encoding.
